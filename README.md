* The dataset consists of several images  and masks divided into the following 2 classes:
  - Cats
  - Dogs
* The dataset consists of 7349 images and masks
* In this notebook uses U-Net model
* U-Net architecture which I implement but with input image size (128,128,3)

* U-Net model with
  - training accuracy 90.7%
  - validation accuracy 90.5%
  - test accuracy 90.6%

*The model runed 20 epoch and returned the best model in epoch 10 with augmentation
